      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I think outside the box for people like you, 
        focused in the realm of art (graphic design) and creating websites. 
        Website Design is what I do, making them look professional, 
        if that isn't your cup of tea, I make logos, t-shirts, hoodies, and even shoe designs.
        The whole point of me being on this earth is not to satisfy myself, 
        it's to satisfy YOU, 
        to be able to give YOU a solution. 
        This is all about YOU. YOU bring the idea and I bring it to life.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>HOME PAGE</h3>
      <p>
        WELCOME TO WONDERLAND! THIS IS WHERE YOU NEED TO BE, BUT WHY??
        So in this page there will be more of my art, the people that I am collaboration with. Art that I have done for some people. This will be the
        expansion of my about me page but more focused on the art I have done. I have some pictures of some shoes, some shirts and jackets as well as logos.
        People can scroll through the picture and see the art. This will also be the place where people get to see why they would choose me over everybody else. I will also
        mention the things that I specify in. This will be the following: illustration, logos, t-shirts, hoodies, (custom painted: shoes, water bottles.) Graphic Design
        Web Development

      </ul>
      <h3>FOR YOU</h3>
      <p>
        OK, so this page will be a little bit more detailed than the other ones. This is going to be a customized page; what this means
        is that there is going to be some pictures (they will be clickable in the future), there will be a picture for a link for each section.
        The sections will be: Logos, Customs designs (painting), Web Design or Choose for yourself. Each section will lead to another page. Imagine
        the wireframe cc but more complicated (hints why the following additions will be for the future). If you were to click on the logo one it would 
        pop up a square link frame with two options, to either contact me or ask feedback for a design you have and have a video call to help you improve it.
        The custom design one will pop you into another page where there are 4 pictures that are also clickable. One would be a shirt( or hoodie), shoes, hydroflask,
        denim jacket. When one is chosen a tool bar would be chosen, as you put start to put things on the shirt or shoe you would be able to see what it would look like.
        Since this is just a rough draft of the persons design the next step would be to confirm their design. I would from my end then proceed to design the shirt or shoe.
        If they picked a shoe I would contact them and ask for what they would like. I tell them about how long it would take. I would sketch out some colored drawings
        so the person can see what their design would look like. (Send them through email and talk with them about the proceedure). If they confirm the design then I would proceed to
        design it. This all seems complicated in words but when I do my wireframe it will all make sense.
