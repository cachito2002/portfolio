                    <p>The Gospel is my life! I love the joy it brings me. This is me at General conference
                        with my Dad, little Brother, Uncle and little cousin. This is in April 2024.

                    <h3>MEXICAN</h3>
                    <p>My family is from Mexico. My Dads side is from Cenotillo, Yucatan and my Moms side is from Michoacan.
                        I love everything there, the food, people, culture, music, and everything you can think of.
                        I am Mexican and I am proud of it.

                    <h3>I LOVE ART</h3>
                    <p>Since I was a small kid I have had a passion for art. Drawing, painting, taking picture etc. The 
                        one that introduced it to me was my sweet mother. She showed me what she knew and I love it and decided to
                        continue with it and practice it more. I love to create and bring things to life!!

                    <h3>MY MISSION</h3>
                    <p>I served in the Florida Fort Lauderdale mission, it was amazing. Part of why I love the Gospel is because it taught
                        to see the potential in others. I strive to help others see and think in the future, to always see the good things in life
                        and to know that with God people can change.

                <h3>MY FAMILY</h3>
                <p>We are 5 in the fam: sister, little brother, mom, dad and I. We strive to help each other out and to better each day.
                    As members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints we believe that families can be together forever. I love my family
                    and I am grateful to be with them and to have them in my life. They have supported me in my journey of art and of being a disicple of Jesus Christ. I love them
                    and they love me. They are lit and they all have their own talents and skills and I love them for it!!!
