                <h1> ABOUT ME!!!</h1>
                <p> This is my humble beginnings, not everybody starts at the top, I am not at the top but one day I want to be.
                    Thank you for letting me serve you in making your designs come to life. I am a 21 year old college student at BYUI at the moment, I am
                    studying computer science and also have a passion for art.

                    <p>I am a member of the CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF lATTER DAY SAINTS, Im mexican and I this is when I went to General Conference in April of 2024
                        Im in the middle and my dad and brother are on the right and my uncle with his my tiny cousin on the left. I love the church and the gospel, 
                        my family try to make it to General Conference every so often. Listening to the prophet of God is a blessing. To know that God still speaks to us today
                        and that revelation is ongoing to this day.

                    <p>YES! If you couldnt tell already, my family is mexican! We love the team and we love the country its in our vains.
                        This is me at NEW YEARS to start of 2024. New year new everyone is the catch phrase hmmm. I strive to be better each day and to become a better person.
                        The family that I have is amazing, I love them so much and they have shown me true love, the love of Christ. They are all great examples for me
                        and I am so grateful to spend another lovely year with them again. I have so many memories of them, they make my day, my every hour. They are my support and they 
                        are everything to me!

                    <img src="images/missionarydistrict.png" alt="me on the mission">
                    <p>I serverd a 2 year mission in Florida Fort Lauderdale. It was the 2 years that I will never forget, I loved them and I will miss them forever.
                        One of the reasons I am doing this business and website thing is to help people like you become heard in the world. There are many people out
                        there that are trying to find a voice or be heard and it was a blessing to help them while I was on the mission by teaching the Gospel and to be
                        able to help your creativity leap off the group and get a running head start. I love my family, my mission family and the Church, it is everything to me,
                        the mission changed who I am and instead of always looking inwards I strive to look outwards, toward other people, to show charity and to help them in any way possible.
